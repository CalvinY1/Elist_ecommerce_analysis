However, in terms of AOV, APAC has the highest average AOV across all 4 years. 
## Loyalty Program
Across all metrics, until 2021, non-loyalty members perform better than loyalty members by far. 
Starting from 2021, loyalty members contribute more across all metrics compared to non-loyalty members until late 2022, where their performance dipped below non-loyalty members again. 
Looking across 4 years, revenue, AOV,and order count have increased for loyalty members, but decreased for non-loyalty members. 
Loyalty program is worth keeping around for longer to continue to monitor trends.
